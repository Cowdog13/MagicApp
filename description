I would like to make a Magic The Gathering life counter that has a timer built in. It should be able to track life for up to 4 players. The players would enter who's first when the game starts and the timer will tick down for that player while they play their turn. Players can push a button to pass the turn so the timer ticks down for the next person in the clockwise direction. There should be a button for any player to press that changes the countdown to their timer while they play a card on an opponents turn. They can then press that button again to resume the player's turn who's it is. Players should be able to customize the timer number for each player and set the starting life with a default of 40. The app also needs to track commander damage which is a number that player need to keep track of seperate for each other player in the game. I would like this app to work on phones or can be used on phones.
